## Guide to the CNCF projects chart creation

`analysis.rb` can be used to create data for a Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects bubble chart such as this one
![sample chart](./linuxfoundation_chart_example.png?raw=true "CNCF projects")

The chart itself can be generated in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_DIvQpaPRecRONWeTh5pp3WOgbGcsY4JOPMBisizJqg/)
or as a [stand-alone html page](../charts/CNCF_bubble_chart_full_with_2016K8s.html). Details on usage of google chart api are [here](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/bubblechart).<br />The first option is a copy/paste of resulting data where the second presents more options to the look of the chart but data insertion is a little difficult.
