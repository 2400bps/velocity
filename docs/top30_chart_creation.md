## Guide to the CNCF projects chart creation

`analysis.rb` can be used to create data for a Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects bubble chart such as this one
![sample chart](./top30_chart_example.png?raw=true "CNCF projects")

The chart itself can be generated in a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14P8bML_jqutv1zzYy588rLSX-GjLy0Cc5aSCBY05CGE/)
or as a [stand-alone html page](../charts/top_30_201611_201710.html)<br />Details on usage of google chart api are [here](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/bubblechart)<br />The first option is a copy/paste of resulting data where the second presents more options to the look of the chart but data insertion is a little difficult.
