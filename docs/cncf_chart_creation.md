## Guide to the CNCF projects chart creation

`analysis.rb` can be used to create data for a Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects bubble chart such as this one
![sample chart](./cncf_chart_example.png?raw=true "CNCF projects")

The chart itself can be generated in a google sheet as in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JzefTCtG0HsLYdvZ5j49wZ5B6Yt2S2l_t76H1Xpod2I
or as a [stand-alone html page](../charts/CNCF_bubble_chart_full_with_2016K8s.html)<br />https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/bubblechart has details on google chart api used for it.
The first option is a copy/paste of resulting data where the second presents more options to the look of the chart but data insertion is a little difficult.
